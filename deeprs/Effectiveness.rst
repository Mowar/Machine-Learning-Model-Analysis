Effectiveness Comparison
#########################

AUC(Area Under ROC)
======================

Logloss (cross entropy)
============================

root mean square error (RMSE)
===============================
positive/negative examples are largly unbalanced in ad click scenario, and the empirically
best regression model usually provides the predicted CTR close to 0, which results
in very small RMSE values and thus the improvement is not well captured

Relative Information Gain(RIG)
=================================

.. math:: RIG=1-NE

Normalized Cross Entropy(NE)
===============================
