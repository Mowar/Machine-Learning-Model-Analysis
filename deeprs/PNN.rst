PNN(Product-based Neural Networks)
###################################

PNN imposes a product layer between the embedding layer and the first hidden layer.

Product layer  capture interactive patterns between interfield categories.

Fully connected layers to explore high-order feature interactions.

local dependencies between features from different fields can be effectively explored by feature vector “product” operations instead of “add”
operations.


purpose
***********

capturing high-order feature interactions

IPNN, OPNN, and PNN∗

- IPNN is based on inner product of vectors
- OPNN is based on outer product
- PNN∗ is based on both inner and outer products.
