FNN(Factorisation Machine supported Neural Network )
#########################################################

FNN with a supervised-learning embedding layer using factorisation
machines is proposed to efficiently reduce the dimension from
sparse features to dense continuous features

The novelty of our deep
learning models lies in the first layer initialisation, where the input raw features
are high dimensional and sparse binary features converted from the raw categorical features, which makes it hard to train traditional DNNs in large scale.


of multi-field and are discrete categorical features, e.g., the user location city
(London, Paris), device type (PC, Mobile), ad category (Sports, Electronics)
etc., and their local dependencies (thus the sparsity in the feature space) are
unknown
