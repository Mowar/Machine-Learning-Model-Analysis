Facotization Machines which are a new model class that combines the advantages
of Support Vector Machines with facorization models.



advantages
*************

* FMs allow parameter estimation under very sparse data where SVMs fail.

* FMs have linear complexity, can be optimized in the primal and do not 
rely on support Vectors like SVMs. We show that FMs acale to large datasets 
like Netflix with 100 millions of training instances.

* FMs are a general predictor that can work with any real valued feature
vector.In contrast to this. other state-of-the-art factorization models 
work only on very restricted input data.
